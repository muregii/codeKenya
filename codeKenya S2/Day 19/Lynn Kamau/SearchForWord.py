#Word search LeetCode Challenge
#Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.
#The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring.
#The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

    rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])

            return True
        if (r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= rows or c >= cols or
            word[i] != board[r][c] or (r, c) in path):
