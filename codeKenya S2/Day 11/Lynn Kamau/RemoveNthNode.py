# Remove Nth Node from End of List Leetcode Challenge
#Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
#The algorithm uses two pointers to find the nth node from the end in a single pass.    
#The first pointer advances n+1 steps ahead, and then both pointers move together until the first pointer reaches the end.
